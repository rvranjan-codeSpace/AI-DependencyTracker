                Based on the inputs provided, generate the corresponding JQL query. The output **must strictly follow** these rules:

                1. If `project_id` is available and 'userStory_id is NA or None', 'testcase_id is NA or Nne', and 'epic_id' is `NA or None'
                   AI Output: project = "{project_id}"

                   AI Output: 'parent = "{epic_id}" AND issuetype = Story

                3. If `epic_id` is available, and `userStory_id`, `testcase_id`, and `project_id` are `NA` or `None`:

                Ensure that outputs are always valid JQL queries and adapt **strictly** to the userâ€™s specific input. **Do not add extra conditions** unless explicitly mentioned in the user's input.

                - Question: Create a mindmap for all issues assgined to me or current user

                - Question: Create a mindmap or Create a JQL of issues that were reported to me and issue type is Story or issue type is Test
                - Gold JQL : project = 'currentUser() AND issuetype IN (Story, Test)'
                - Question: Create a mindmap for project ABC of type Story
                - Gold JQL : project = "ABC"
                - Question: Create a mindmap or Create a JQL for project BGRFG and issuetype is Story 
                - Gold JQL : project = "{project_id}" AND issueType='story'
                - Question: Create a mindmap or Create a JQL for project ABC and issuetype is Story and issue type is test 
                - Gold JQL : project = "{project_id}" AND issueType IN (story,test)'
                - Question: Create a mindmap  for all issues whose status is in progess or to do"
                - Gold JQL : status In ("In Progress", "To Do")
                - Question: Create a mindmap or JQL for project{project_id} for all issues whcih has not been assigned or whose assigness ine empty
                - Gold JQL : assignee is empty ANF project IN(ABC)
                - Question: Create a mind map or under epic XSP-3 and XSP-8 of issue type story, test or bug
                - Gold JQL : parent In (XSP-3, XSP-8) and type In (story, test, bug)
                - Question: Find all issues under epic XSP-3 of issue type story
                - Gold JQL : parent In (XSP-3) and type In (story)
                - Question: Find the issue with with a link type of "duplicates" in project ABC
                - Gold JQL :issueLinkType in (duplicates,clones)AND project='ABC'
                - Question: Find the issue that are blocked by other issues, or that don't have any blockers:
                - Gold JQL: issueLinkType = "is blocked by"
                - Question: Find the issue that are blocked by other issues in the epic (or under the epic) XSP-3 and XSP-8
                - Gold JQL: parent In (XSP-3, XSP-8) and issueLinkType = "is blocked by"
                - Question: Find the issue that are blocked by other issues in the project(or under the project ARMY and KJL
                - Gold JQL :project IN (XSP, ARMY) and issueLinkType = "is blocked by"

                Your thought : Did it match one of the Gold Examples above ?
                Yes : Construct the JQL referring to example
                Your thought: if {project_id} is 'NA' , did you exclude it from JQL ? If no , Please contruct JQL and exclude {project_id}
                Your thought:if {epic_id} is 'NA' , did you exclude it from JQL ? If no , Please contruct JQL and exclude {epic_id}
                Your thought:if {testcase_id} is 'NA' , did you exclude it from JQL ? If no , Please contruct JQL and exclude {testcase_id}
                Your thought:if {userStory_id} is 'NA' , did you exclude it from JQL ? If no , Please contruct JQL and exclude {userStory_id}

                Your thought : Did you replace the {project_id}, {epic_id},{testcase_id} and {userStory_id} with actual values as provided by the user query.
                Stricly Please dont provide JQL with "project=your project id" and "parent=parent_id". It has to be a validd values so that JQL is executable
            
            
                ### Your answer:
                your answer has to be direclty fed to JQL engine. So it should be executable JQL. Dont add any comments or explantion in your answer.
